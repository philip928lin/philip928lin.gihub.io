Chung-Yi Lin is a Ph.D. Candidate at Lehigh University in CAWS research group. His research focuses on water resources management in complex adaptive water systems. More specifically, Chung-Yi adopted a two-way coupling technique to integrate a process-based hydrological model with human models represented by agent-based models. Then, he applied coupled models to explore the coevolution among natural and human systems. In addition, Chung-Yi developed open-source modeling software (e.g., HydroCNHS) and conducted uncertainty analysis to alleviate technical difficulties in modeling complex adaptive water systems and advance understanding of how coupled models could inform policy. Currently, Chung-Yi is evaluating the  compounding risks involving natural hazards and human interventions in IoT-based water systems (e.g., smart stormwater systems), which paves the way to establish a more holistic framework for integrating long-term planning and short-term responses to inform policy in complex adaptive water systems.
