Chung-Yi Lin is a postdoctoral associate at Virginia Tech with expertise in water resources management, water systems analysis, and modeling of human-water systems. He holds a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from Lehigh University and M.S. in Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering from National Taiwan University.

*Chung-Yi's research seeks to understand the driving forces and underlying mechanisms of co-evolved human-water systems, a fundamental prerequisite for effective, risk-based decision-making.* Through his research, Chung-Yi develops innovative methods and models to address complex water issues related to agriculture, food-energy systems, groundwater, stormwater systems, and disaster risk reduction. His work focuses on integrating human behaviors and decision-making into simulations to evaluate policy and technology interventions. Chung-Yi has published 6 journal articles and has 5 more in preparation. 

At Virginia Tech, Chung-Yi teaches undergraduate courses and mentors graduate students. He is actively involved in professional service, reviewing papers and participating in committees for organizations like AGU Water and Society Technical Committee and AGU Hydrology Section Student Subcommittee. Chung-Yi combines strong computational skills with a passion for interdisciplinary collaboration to drive progress on pressing water challenges facing communities worldwide.
