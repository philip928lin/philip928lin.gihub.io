Improving the understanding of coupled natural human systems (CNHS) can better inform environmental policymaking. We investigated the co-evolution (i.e., bidirectional interactions) issues in CNHS via two-way coupling RiverWare (RW; a river-reservoir routing model) with agent-based models (ABMs, human decision models) in the Yakima River Basin in Washington, US. Results show that coupled models can better capture the historical irrigation diversion (human) and streamflow (nature) dynamics. We further demonstrated the effect of social norms (i.e., the influence of neighbors) among farmers and tested a “water reallocation” scenario to evaluate the influence of water policies on irrigation diversion behaviors. Detailed model structure and parameter uncertainty analysis are suggested to further quantify the benefit of CNHS models in multi-level water resources governance.
