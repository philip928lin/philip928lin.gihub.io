To comprehensively assess the climate risk originating from climate change, this study aims at developing a novel climate adaptation algorithm, representing not only on the basis of Climate Change Adaptation Six Steps (CCA6Steps), but also innovations in climate risk template. The climate risk template is proposed as a climate risk analysis tool based on the procedure of CCA6Steps, including the identification of problems and objectives, the analysis of current and future risks, and the assessment of adaptation options, to identify the relationship between the climate risk components, including hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. An application is implemented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in this study. The results show that the problems and objectives which concern the governance level and stakeholders can be clearly identified by the proposed algorithm. The relationship between climate-related hazards, exposure, and vulnerability of the protected target can also be precisely investigated. Furthermore, the climate adaptation strategies able to mitigate the impact of hazards on the protected target are further discussed in this study. In summary, the proposed climate adaptation algorithm is expected to provide a standard operating procedure and be a useful tool to support climate risk assessment.
